## Description
We face common problem of corruption with many charity organizations and the donors are worrying about many things like how my money is being use? For what purposes are money used?Have I donated at the correct charity where there is actual need?Can I donate at better place?. This happens mainly because there is no clarity of each transaction that happens after the charity amount is paid to organization, causing chaos and mistrust issues in the society.

We are planning to build a project using block-chain Ethereum platform that can record the transactional flow of where money goes and how it is used. As block-chain provides decentralized system having properties of security and transparency , this project would help in achieving less corruption and more integrity, therefore, promote the philanthropy all over the world! 


## User Interface
1. Register users with one of the role as 'Donor', 'Acceptor' , 'Charity
2. Login with username and password generated.
3. Donor can see the charity cart with all requirments.
4. By clicking on donate, he claims that charity cart.
